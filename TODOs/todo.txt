Bugs:
	Display:
		Spellcasting tabs are displayed inproperly, switching between them is possible tho
		Cursor icons are drawn twice

	Logic:
		Items thrown on the right side end up on the left side 

Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	
	Double check enums with hex literals
	Double check strcat, strstr usages
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Code stuff todo:

	Save file f433_processCommand140_saveGame fails silently, add error checking
	Clean up f113_drawField
