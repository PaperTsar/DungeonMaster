Bugs:
	Display:
		Broken colour palette
		Portraits, alcoves etc. look broken from afar
		Ornaments are not displayed if looked at from certain angles
		Ornaments are displayed where they should not be, probably error in the pseudo RNG
		Command gui is broken
	Logic:
		Game crashes when reincaranting a fourth champion and trying to copy his portrait



Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	Rename GraphicIndice enum entires and have their name include GraphicIndice
	I forgot to add localization warnings
	Attend to Arnaud's notes on github
	Attend to sev's notes on github
	Double check enums with hex literals, I think I screwed the regex when processing them
	Double check strcat, strstr usages, I might have messed them up in many places
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer

	Missing functions:
		 Add missing  F0163_DUNGEON_LinkThingToList in MovesensMan::sensorIsTriggeredByClickOnWall (I don't think it's safe yet)
