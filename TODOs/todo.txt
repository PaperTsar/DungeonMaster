Bugs:
	Display:
		Broken colour palette
		Portraits, alcoves etc. look broken from afar
		Arrow and hand display is messed up

	Logic:
		When object are put on the right side of the current square, they disappear
		Drawing door ornaments segfaults when going back to the start
	  !! It seems that that deleted events' _type fields are not getting set to 0, when looking for available slots, the code looks for events with 0 _type fields, 
	  		this results in segfaults

Possible bugs:
	- k1_LeftMouseButton and k2_RightMouseButton have values 1 and 2 respectively, contrary to the original in the original: MASK0x0001_MOUSE_RIGHT_BUTTON, MASK0x0002_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON
	- possible garbage value return in f140_getObjectWeight
	
Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	Rename GraphicIndice enum entires and have their name include GraphicIndice
	I forgot to add localization warnings
	Attend to Arnaud's notes on github
	Attend to sev's notes on github
	Double check enums with hex literals, I think I screwed the regex when processing them
	Double check strcat, strstr usages, I might have messed them up in many places
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Finish stuff:
	f380_processCommandQueue
	Missing main loop methods
	F0577_VBLANK_Handler, if enought time passes, takes the player's chance to act
		- TODO: implement it
		- NOTE: _g318_waitForInputMaxVerticalBlankCount is already included in the engine
