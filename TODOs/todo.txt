Bugs:
	Display:
		Broken colour palette
		Portraits, alcoves etc. look broken from afar
		Arrow and hand display is messed up
		Items are displayed in the wrong cells

		Gui is messed up by drawn spell area line on startup
		Spellcasting tabs are displayed inproperly, switching between them is possible tho


	Logic:
		When object are put on the right side of the current square, they disappear
		Object display is a bit mixed up with regards to which cell is it drawn in

		


Possible bugs:
	- k1_LeftMouseButton and k2_RightMouseButton have values 1 and 2 respectively, contrary to the original in the original: MASK0x0001_MOUSE_RIGHT_BUTTON, MASK0x0002_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON
	- possible garbage value return in f140_getObjectWeight
	- After loading, creatures are in the wrong cells of a square

	
Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	
	I forgot to add localization warnings
	Double check enums with hex literals
	Double check strcat, strstr usages
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Finish stuff:
	f380_processCommandQueue
	Missing main loop methods
	Save file f433_processCommand140_saveGame fails silently
	Sounds
	F0438_STARTEND_OpenEntranceDoors
	F0442_STARTEND_ProcessCommand202_EntranceDrawCredits
	G0335_ui_SelectedDialogChoice
	Add dialogs
	Add failcheck to saveing and loading
	F0444_STARTEND_Endgame


Refactoring
	Places implementing mini mainloop and where input doesn't really matter should call discardInput instead of processInput
