Bugs:
	Display:
		Broken colour palette
		Portraits, alcoves etc. look broken from afar
		Arrow and hand display is messed up

	Logic:
		When object are put on the right side of the current square, they disappear
		Drawing door ornaments segfaults when going back to the start
		Placing one of the play icons from the top right corner into one of the champions' hands will crash the engine
		Sometimes putting stuff in the player's hand segfaults
		Object display is a bit mixed up with regards to which cell is it drawn in
		Method cthulu messes up the callstack


Possible bugs:
	- k1_LeftMouseButton and k2_RightMouseButton have values 1 and 2 respectively, contrary to the original in the original: MASK0x0001_MOUSE_RIGHT_BUTTON, MASK0x0002_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON
	- possible garbage value return in f140_getObjectWeight
	- After loading, creatures are in the wrong cells of a square

	
Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	
	I forgot to add localization warnings
	Double check enums with hex literals
	Double check strcat, strstr usages
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Finish stuff:
	f380_processCommandQueue
	Missing main loop methods
	Save file f433_processCommand140_saveGame fails silently
