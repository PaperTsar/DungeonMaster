Bugs:
	Display:
		Broken colour palette
		Portraits, alcoves etc. look broken from afar
		Arrow and hand display is messed up

	Logic:
		When object are put on the right side of the current square, they disappear
		Drawing door ornaments segfaults when going back to the start 



Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	Rename GraphicIndice enum entires and have their name include GraphicIndice
	I forgot to add localization warnings
	Attend to Arnaud's notes on github
	Attend to sev's notes on github
	Double check enums with hex literals, I think I screwed the regex when processing them
	Double check strcat, strstr usages, I might have messed them up in many places
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Finish stuff:
	f380_processCommandQueue
	Missing main loop methods
	F0577_VBLANK_Handler, if enought time passes, takes the player's chance to act
		- TODO: implement it
		- NOTE: _g318_waitForInputMaxVerticalBlankCount is already included in the engine
